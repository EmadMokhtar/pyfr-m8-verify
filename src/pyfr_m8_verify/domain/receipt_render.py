"""Rendering an Order into a receipt document.

A pure function: same order in, same bytes out, no I/O and no clock. That
is not incidental — it is what lets GetReceipt store the result once and
serve it forever, and what lets a test assert that a re-render matches what
was stored.

Deliberately NO `generated_at` timestamp. It is the obvious field to add
and it would destroy determinism: every re-render after an eviction would
produce different bytes under the same key, so "the receipt for order X"
would depend on when it happened to be regenerated. The order carries the
facts a receipt needs; when the document was serialised is not one of them.
