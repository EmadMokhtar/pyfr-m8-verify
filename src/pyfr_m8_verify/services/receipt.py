"""GetReceipt: serve a stored receipt, rendering it the first time.

An application service. It orchestrates — repository, renderer, store — and
holds no business rules of its own; what a receipt CONTAINS is
domain/receipt_render.py's decision.

Why the order is looked up FIRST, before the store:

  1. It gives the right answer for an unknown identifier. A store-first
     service would return a receipt for an order that no longer resolves,
     and would reach object storage for every bogus id a caller cared to
     invent.
  2. It costs almost nothing. When a cache is configured that read is a
     Redis hit, not a database query — the two halves of M4 pay for each
     other here.

Why the store is not written by PlaceOrder: an object-store outage must
never be able to fail a payment. Rendering on demand keeps storage entirely
out of the write path, at the cost of one slower first request per order.
