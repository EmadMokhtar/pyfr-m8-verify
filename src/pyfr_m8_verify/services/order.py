"""Order application services: PlaceOrder and GetOrder.

An application service orchestrates a use case: it turns a command into
domain objects, lets the Order aggregate enforce its own rules, and hands
the result to a repository. It holds no business rules of its own — those
live in the domain layer, in the Order aggregate. (This is not a domain
service — a domain service holds business logic that belongs to no single
entity and lives in the domain layer; these hold no business logic at all.)
This single property, no business rules here, is exactly what the import
contracts and `test_layer_purity.py` verify.

This module also defines PlaceOrder's command objects, PlaceOrderCommand and
PlaceOrderLine — the service layer's own input type. A command is
deliberately not an HTTP schema and not a domain entity: the api layer maps
into it, and PlaceOrder maps out of it into the domain.
