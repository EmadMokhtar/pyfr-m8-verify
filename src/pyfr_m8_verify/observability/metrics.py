"""Instruments this service reports about itself.

RED — rate, errors, duration — arrives free from the FastAPI
instrumentation. What is here instead is saturation: the signals that
move BEFORE the error rate does, which is what makes them worth a panel.
A connection pool sitting at its ceiling is a queue, and a queue is
latency that has not been served yet. An event loop that has stopped
keeping up is the explanation for a service being slow while the database
is fast and the processor is idle.
