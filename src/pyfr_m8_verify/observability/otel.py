"""OpenTelemetry SDK wiring: resource, providers, exporters, instrumentation.

Everything the SDK needs is built here and nowhere else, so the rest of the
service never imports `opentelemetry` — a rule the import-linter contracts
enforce for domain/ and services/.

Two functions build providers. `build_providers` is pure construction and
takes exporter overrides, which is what the tests use. `configure_otel`
wraps it and additionally installs the process-global providers, so that
application code written later can call `trace.get_tracer(__name__)` and
get a real tracer. OpenTelemetry permits that global installation exactly
once per process, which is why no test calls `configure_otel` twice.

    A GLOBAL instrumentor, unlike instrument_http_client's per-client
    attachment: redis-py has no per-client hook, so this patches the
    library. `RedisInstrumentor` is also a process-wide SINGLETON
    (`BaseInstrumentor.__new__` always returns the same instance), so only
    the FIRST call in a process binds `tracer_provider` — every later call
    is a no-op regardless of which provider it is given.

    A raw double call would already be harmless without this guard:
    `RedisInstrumentor.instrument()` calls `super().instrument()`, and
    `BaseInstrumentor.instrument()` itself checks
    `_is_instrumented_by_opentelemetry` and returns `None` before it could
    double-patch. What the guard here actually earns its place for is
    quieter test output: without it, every one of the many app instances
    the test suite builds in one process would re-trigger that base-class
    check and log a `WARNING: Attempting to instrument while already
    instrumented` — this short-circuits before that call, so the log stays
    clean.

    Worth having despite the cache being optional: the span is how you find
    out that a "fast" cache read is actually costing 40ms, which is the
    exact failure a fail-open cache hides from every other signal — the
    request still succeeds, so no error rate moves.

    No `_opt_in_to_stable_semconv()` call here, unlike the instrumentors
    above: redis-py has no legacy/stable HTTP semantic-convention split to
    opt into — that env var governs only the HTTP attribute set, and a
    Redis span's attributes (`db.system`, `db.statement`) are unaffected
    by it either way.

    Deliberately no `opentelemetry-instrumentation-botocore` counterpart
    beside this function. Task 12's Step 1 measured whether that
    instrumentor sees `aioboto3`'s S3 calls at all: instrumenting, then
    running ListBuckets, CreateBucket, PutObject and GetObject through an
    `aioboto3.Session` against a real MinIO container produced zero spans
    on an `InMemorySpanExporter`/`ConsoleSpanExporter`, even though
    `is_instrumented_by_opentelemetry` reported `True` and every call
    itself succeeded. `aioboto3` runs on `aiobotocore`, which replaces the
    parts of `botocore`'s client machinery the instrumentor patches with
    async equivalents the instrumentor's hooks never see. Shipping that
    instrumentation would mean an S3 span that silently never appears,
    which is worse than no span: a dashboard or trace search built against
    it would read as "S3 calls are always fast" rather than "S3 calls are
    not observed". See the Task 12 report for the full probe transcript.
