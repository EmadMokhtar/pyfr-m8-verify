    Two tiers, and which one a dependency belongs in is a judgement about
    BLAST RADIUS, not about importance:

      gating        — losing it means this instance cannot do useful work.
                      A failure returns 503 and the orchestrator stops
                      sending traffic here. The database is the only one.

                      Reported so an operator can see it, and never allowed
                      to affect the status code.

    The cache is informational because it fails open: when Redis is gone,
    PostgreSQL answers and every response is still correct. Gating on it
    would be actively harmful, because Redis is SHARED — every pod would
    fail the check in the same second and the whole service would leave
    the load balancer over a degradation it was built to survive.

    Object storage is informational for a different reason with the same
    answer: losing it breaks one endpoint, so taking 100% of traffic off
    the pod to protect that slice costs far more than it saves.

    This is the same reasoning build_container already records for not
    registering the payment provider at all. The difference is that these
    two are REPORTED, which spec 12.1 asks for and which costs nothing.
