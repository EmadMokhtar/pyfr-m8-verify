"""Print the resolved configuration with every secret masked.

    just config-check
    docker compose run --rm app python -m pyfr_m8_verify.config_check

Loads settings exactly as the service does at startup, so a malformed
environment exits with the same readable message and the same exit code
(78, EX_CONFIG) -- which makes this the thing to run when the service
will not start (docs/runbook.md). A valid environment prints one JSON
object, keys sorted.

Two layers of masking. `model_dump(mode="json")` renders every
`SecretStr` as `**********`. That is not enough on its own (M6 plan,
Verified Fact 7): a DSN setting is a URL type, and a URL's password is
plain text inside the dumped string. `mask` walks the dump and blanks
the password of any string that parses as a URL carrying credentials --
generic, so a DSN field added later is covered without opting in.
