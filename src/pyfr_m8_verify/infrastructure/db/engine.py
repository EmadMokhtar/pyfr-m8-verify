# ValueError from inside FastAPI's lifespan instead: a traceback and
# SystemExit: 3, not the exit 78 README.md documents for every other bad
# setting). This copy stays as defence in depth for any caller that builds
# an engine from a DatabaseSettings assembled some other way than through
# Settings/load_settings — a script, a future test — and so never ran
# that validator: rejecting it here, at startup, with the setting named,
# still beats a TypeError from inside asyncpg at the first request.
