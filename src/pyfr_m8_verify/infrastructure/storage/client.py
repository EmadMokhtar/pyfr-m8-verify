Construction only, mirroring infrastructure/db/engine.py and

behaviour.

async context manager that opens and closes one per use. That shapes

    botocore's defaults are 60 seconds for both timeouts and a retry mode
    that keeps trying — numbers chosen for batch jobs, not for a request a
    person is waiting on. Left alone, a single unreachable bucket would hold
    an HTTP handler open for minutes.

    `max_attempts=2` is one retry, not none: an S3 call crosses a network
    and a single dropped connection is common enough to be worth one more
    try. More than that belongs behind a circuit breaker, which this
    dependency does not have — and unlike the payment gateway, an
    unavailable store costs one endpoint rather than the ability to take
    money.

    `s3={"addressing_style": "path"}` is what makes MinIO work. The default,
    virtual-host addressing, sends requests to
    `<bucket>.<endpoint>` — a hostname that does not resolve for MinIO,
    which serves buckets as PATHS under one host. Real S3 accepts both, so
    path style is correct for every provider rather than a local-only
    workaround.
