"""The S3-compatible receipt store.

One adapter for every S3-compatible provider — Amazon S3, MinIO, Cloudflare
R2, Ceph, Backblaze B2 — distinguished only by StorageSettings.endpoint_url
(spec 9.1). There is deliberately no provider branch anywhere below.

A client per operation, not one held for the process's lifetime. That looks
wasteful and is not: aioboto3's `session.client()` is an async context
manager whose exit closes the underlying aiohttp connector, and a client
created once at startup outlives the event loop it was bound to, which
surfaces later as `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` on the first call
after a reconnect. botocore pools sockets underneath, so the per-call cost
is object construction rather than a new TCP connection. The alternative —
an `AsyncExitStack` held on the container — was considered and rejected: it
buys a small saving and costs a lifetime that has to be correct across
startup, shutdown and every test fixture.
