"""A caching decorator over the OrderRepository port.

This class satisfies `OrderRepository` and holds another `OrderRepository`.
Nothing above it — not GetOrder, not PlaceOrder, not the router, not the
domain — knows it exists. That is the point of the port: a cache is added
by wrapping in container.py and removed by not wrapping.

Two rules govern everything below.

FAIL OPEN. Every Redis failure is logged and swallowed, and the wrapped
repository answers. A cache exists to make reads faster; one that can make
them FAIL has made the service strictly worse than having no cache. There
is deliberately no setting that changes this.

THE DATABASE IS THE TRUTH. This class never returns something the wrapped
repository could not have returned, and never lets a write reach Redis
without reaching the repository first.
