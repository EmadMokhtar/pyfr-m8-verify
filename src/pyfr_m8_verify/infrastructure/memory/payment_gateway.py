"""A payment gateway that authorises everything.

The counterpart to InMemoryOrderRepository, and there for the same
reason: with no APP_PAYMENT__BASE_URL set, `just dev` starts a service
that works end to end with no upstream anywhere. It is also what the api
tests use, which keeps them free of HTTP mocking entirely.
