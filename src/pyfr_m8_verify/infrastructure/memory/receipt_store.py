"""In-memory receipt store.

The adapter selected when no object storage is configured, so the receipt
endpoint works on a laptop with nothing running but the application — the
same job InMemoryOrderRepository does for the database. Receipts vanish on
restart, which is harmless: a receipt is derived from its order and is
re-rendered on the next request.
