"""Errors raised by the infrastructure layer itself.

Deliberately NOT a DomainError. A DomainError says a business rule was
broken, which is a statement about the caller's request and maps to a 4xx.
What lives here says storage handed back something the domain refuses to
accept, which is this service's fault, not the caller's, and maps to a 5xx.
Keeping it out of both DomainError's hierarchy and services/errors.py's
ServiceDefectError is what stops it being mistaken for either in
api/errors.py — and it lives here, in infrastructure/, rather than in
services/errors.py, because infrastructure must not import services (an
upward dependency the architecture forbids); a new error type needed only
by infrastructure belongs beside the code that raises it.

class CorruptPersistedDataError(Exception):
    """A stored row failed the domain's own validation on the way back out.

    infrastructure/db/mappers.py's to_domain() rebuilds an Order through the
    real Pydantic model, which reruns every validator — including
    Order.total_must_match_lines — on load, not only on write. A row can
    fail that check without the application ever writing anything invalid:
    hand edits, a restore from a backup taken mid-migration, or a write from
    another service entirely can all leave a row PostgreSQL is perfectly
    willing to return but the domain is not willing to accept.

    That failure is a storage consistency problem, not something the caller
    who happened to ask for this order did wrong — so it must not become a
    pydantic.ValidationError that escapes to api/errors.py's
    _pydantic_validation_error handler, which exists for genuine client
    faults and (before this type existed) turned a corrupted row into a 422
    whose body quoted the row's own field values, including internal_note.
    No handler is registered for this type on purpose — it falls through to
    the catch-all in api/errors.py, which logs the full traceback and
    returns a 500 that describes none of our internals.
    """


class StorageConstraintViolatedError(Exception):
    """The database refused a write because one of its constraints failed.

    The CHECK constraints in migrations/000002 mirror invariants the domain
    already enforces (`quantity > 0`, amounts `>= 0`), so reaching one of them
    means the domain was bypassed — a bug on a second write path, a hand-run
    statement, or another service writing to the same tables. That is this
    system's fault rather than the caller's, so like its siblings here it gets
    no registered handler and falls through to the catch-all in api/errors.py,
    which logs a traceback and returns a 500 describing none of our internals.

    It exists for a second reason, and that one is about disclosure. When
    PostgreSQL rejects a row it puts the offending VALUES in its own error
    DETAIL — `Failing row contains (..., internal_note)` for a CHECK, `Key
    (col)=(value) already exists` for a unique violation — and asyncpg carries
    that straight into the exception text. `hide_parameters=True` on the engine
    cannot reach it: that setting governs SQLAlchemy's echo of the parameters
    the CLIENT sent, not text the SERVER composed. Verified against PostgreSQL
    16.13: the failing row, `internal_note` included, appears in `str(exc)`
    identically with `hide_parameters` on and off. Since the catch-all logs the
    exception, that put row data in a log line.

    Raising this type instead is what closes it — see the comment on the
    `except` clause in db/order_repository.py's save(), which explains why the
    replacement message is built from an allowlist of identifier fields and
    why it must be raised with `from None`.
