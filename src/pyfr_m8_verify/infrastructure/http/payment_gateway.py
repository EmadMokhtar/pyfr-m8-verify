"""The HTTP implementation of the payment port.

Three layers, and their order is the design:

    breaker( retry( one HTTP request ) )

The breaker is OUTSIDE. Retries are attempts at one logical call, so
three retries against a dead gateway must register as one failure. Nested
the other way, the breaker would open at a third of its configured
threshold and nobody would understand why.

And a declined payment is neither: it is a successful call with a
negative answer. It never retries and never counts towards the breaker,
which is why `_send` returns 402 as a value rather than raising.
