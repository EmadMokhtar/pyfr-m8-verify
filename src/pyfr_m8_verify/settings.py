"""Application configuration.

Settings are read once at startup and are frozen. A missing or malformed
variable stops the process immediately with a readable message, rather than
producing a 500 response an hour later.

"Frozen" is precise, not a slogan: `SettingsConfigDict(frozen=True)` on
`Settings` is NOT recursive — it only refuses reassigning `Settings`'s own
top-level fields (`settings.http_port = 9000` raises). Without their own
`model_config`, `settings.log` and `settings.otel` would still allow
`settings.log.level = "debug"` to succeed silently. `LogSettings` and
`OtelSettings` below each carry `frozen=True` for exactly this reason.

One gap remains even with both frozen: `LogSettings.levels` is a plain
`dict`. `frozen=True` refuses REASSIGNING the `levels` field itself
(`settings.log.levels = {...}` raises), but the dict object it already
holds stays an ordinary mutable dict — `settings.log.levels["x"] = "debug"`
succeeds. Nothing in this codebase mutates it, so this is not a live bug,
but a docstring claiming settings are simply "frozen" without this caveat
would be claiming more than the code delivers.
