    Three approaches are wrong, and it is worth recording why.

    `scope["route"].path` alone: FastAPI 0.141 stores an included router
    lazily, so a router mounted under `/api/v1` reports only its inner
    `/orders/{order_id}`. Two API versions of one resource then look
    identical in the logs.

    `scope["path"]` alone: that is the raw path, so every identifier becomes
    a distinct value — the unbounded cardinality this field exists to avoid.

    Substituting parameter VALUES out of the raw path: subtly wrong, because
    it matches by text. A request to `/api/v1/orders/orders` would rewrite
    the literal `/orders` segment too, giving `/api/v1/{order_id}/{order_id}`.
    It also silently fails for a parameter whose value spans segments, such
    as a `:path` converter, falling back to the raw path.

    So work the other way round. Fill the route's own template with the
    matched values to get the concrete path it produced; whatever the raw
    path carries in front of that is the mount prefix. Positional rather
    than textual, and correct for multi-segment values.

    Known limitation, not fixed here: if `include_router` is ever called
    with a PARAMETERISED prefix (e.g. `prefix="/tenants/{tenant_id}"`),
    the mount prefix itself is returned verbatim rather than templated, so
    that segment is not cardinality-bounded. Every prefix in this service
    is a literal today.
