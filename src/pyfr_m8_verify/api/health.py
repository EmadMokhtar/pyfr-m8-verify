"""Health endpoints.

Three endpoints, three different questions:

  /healthz   liveness  — is this process alive? It must NEVER check a
                         dependency. If it did, a brief database problem
                         would make the orchestrator restart every pod at
                         once, turning a small outage into a large one.
  /readyz    readiness — can this instance serve traffic right now? Gating
                         dependencies are checked with short timeouts and a
                         failure returns 503. Informational ones are
                         reported under `dependencies` and never change the
                         status code — see ReadinessRegistry.
  /startupz  startup   — has startup finished? Covers slow first starts.
