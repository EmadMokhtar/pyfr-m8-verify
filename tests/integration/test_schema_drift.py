"""Gate 4 of five: the SQLAlchemy models against the real migrated schema.

ALEMBIC IS NOT A MIGRATION TOOL IN THIS PROJECT. golang-migrate owns the
schema (spec D12): there is no alembic/ directory, no alembic.ini and no
alembic_version table, and nothing here generates a migration. Alembic is
installed as a development dependency for exactly one function —
compare_metadata — which is the only readily available engine that can diff a
set of SQLAlchemy models against a live database. This test asserts the
difference list is EMPTY. That restores the "you changed a model and forgot
the migration" protection that adopting golang-migrate would otherwise have
given up. See the comment beside alembic in pyproject.toml.
