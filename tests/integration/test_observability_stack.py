"""The whole chain, once: app -> OTLP -> Prometheus -> rules -> Grafana.

Every other test in this milestone checks one link. This one checks that
they are actually connected, which is the failure the others cannot see:
each half correct, the join wrong, and every dashboard empty.

Slow — roughly a minute — and container-bound, so it lives in the
integration tier.
