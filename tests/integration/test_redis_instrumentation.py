"""A Redis command must appear as a span carrying the statement.

Same reasoning as test_db_instrumentation.py's module docstring: without
this, a slow endpoint tells you only that it was slow. With it, the trace
shows whether the time went to Redis and to which command — the signal
that a fail-open cache read costing 40ms would otherwise hide from every
other metric, because the request still succeeds.
