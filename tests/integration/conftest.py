"""Containers for the integration tier.

One PostgreSQL container for the whole session, migrated once with the real
golang-migrate image, on a shared Docker network so the two containers can
find each other by name. Tables are truncated between tests, which is far
cheaper than a container per test and gives the same isolation.

Rule for every test module added to this directory: if it uses the
`sessionmaker` fixture below (or anything built on the same engine), it
must carry its own module-level `pytestmark =
pytest.mark.asyncio(loop_scope="session")`. pytest-asyncio does expose a
project-wide `asyncio_default_test_loop_scope` ini option that would apply
this scope everywhere at once, but pyproject.toml deliberately leaves it at
pytest-asyncio's own default ("function") rather than set it there: a
project-wide change would also alter event-loop behaviour for the async
tests in tests/unit/ and tests/api/, which have no need of it. Two
alternatives that WOULD have been central to just this directory — a
marker added dynamically in `pytest_collection_modifyitems` below, and a
package-level `pytestmark` in this directory's `__init__.py` — were both
tried and confirmed not to work; see `pytest_collection_modifyitems`'s
docstring for the mechanism. A module that forgets the rule does not fail
quietly: it crashes with `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` on the
second test in that module that opens a session — loud enough to point
back here. See `sessionmaker`'s docstring for the full mechanism this rule
protects against.

def pytest_collection_modifyitems(items: list[pytest.Item]) -> None:
    """Mark everything in this directory `integration` automatically.

    The marker is what `-m 'not integration'` in pyproject.toml's addopts
    filters out of the default run. Applying it here rather than by hand
    means a new test file cannot forget it and quietly make `just test`
    require Docker.

    The `_THIS_DIRECTORY in Path(item.path).resolve().parents` guard is
    load-bearing, not decorative, in two separate ways. First:
    `pytest_collection_modifyitems` implementations from EVERY conftest.py
    pytest loads are registered as session-wide hooks and all run against
    the FULL, whole-session `items` list once — a local conftest.py does
    not confine its own hook to its own directory. An unconditional `for
    item in items: item.add_marker(...)` here would mark every test in the
    ENTIRE suite `integration`, not just this directory's, which turns
    `-m 'not integration'` into "match nothing": `just test` would exit
    with pytest's NO_TESTS_COLLECTED (5) instead of running the unit and
    api tiers, and `just test-integration` would silently run the whole
    suite rather than just this directory. Confirmed empirically while
    building this file: the unscoped version reproduces both symptoms
    exactly. Second: `item.path` must be resolved before the comparison,
    not compared raw — `_THIS_DIRECTORY` above is already `.resolve()`d,
    and a symlink anywhere in the checkout's path could make an unresolved
    `item.path` fail to appear in its `.parents`, so the guard would stop
    matching and every test here would silently lose the marker — this
    exact bug arriving again, by a different door.

    This hook is deliberately NOT where the event-loop scope described in
    this file's module docstring gets fixed, even though that has the same
    "one place, so no file forgets it" shape as the marker above.
    `sessionmaker` is session-scoped, but pytest-asyncio decides which
    event loop scope a test uses inside ITS OWN `pytest_generate_tests` —
    which runs per test function during collection, before this hook ever
    sees the collected `items` list. A marker added here, via
    `item.add_marker(...)`, is provably too late: confirmed empirically by
    adding `pytest.mark.asyncio(loop_scope="session")` right here and
    checking `pytest --setup-plan`, which still showed
    `_function_scoped_runner` for every test. A package-level `pytestmark`
    in this directory's `__init__.py` was tried too and also made no
    difference. `pytestmark` at the top of a test MODULE is read early
    enough (module import happens before `pytest_generate_tests` fires for
    that module's functions) — which is why the rule lives there instead,
    stated at the top of this file.

    An `async` fixture, not a plain one, and pinned to `loop_scope="session"`

    pyproject.toml never sets): every test in this directory shares ONE
    event loop via `pytestmark = pytest.mark.asyncio(loop_scope="session")`
    in each test module (this file's module docstring states that as a
    rule for every file added here; `pytest_collection_modifyitems` below

    resolve to that SAME loop — matching scope names share the identical
    `_session_scoped_runner` fixture pytest-asyncio creates on demand — so
    the engine's pooled connections are always used, and disposed, on the

    The disposal itself is what this fixture adds over a plain `return`:
    `AsyncEngine.dispose()` closes every pooled connection cleanly. Without
    it, the engine and its still-open asyncpg connections are only ever
    reclaimed by garbage collection, at some later, unpredictable point —
    possibly after the loop that owns them has already closed — and
    asyncpg's own `Connection.__del__` responds to exactly that by raising
    a `ResourceWarning` instead of actually closing anything.
    pyproject.toml's `filterwarnings = ["error"]` then turns that warning
    into a hard error during pytest's shutdown, failing the whole run even
    though every test already passed. Confirmed empirically: before this
    fixture disposed the engine, `just test-integration` reported "8
    passed" and still exited 1, via three `ResourceWarning`s (an asyncpg
