    construction for anything reachable through save()/get() alone —
    confirmed the hard way. An earlier version of this test did exactly
    that (save(), then get()), and passed 10 times out of 10 with
    `.order_by(OrderLineRow.line_number)` removed from get(): PostgreSQL
    chose a Bitmap Heap Scan for the order_lines lookup, which returns rows
    in physical heap order, and a freshly inserted, never-updated set of
    rows has physical order equal to insertion order — so the old test
    could not fail for the reason it existed.

    This version reaches around save() and inserts the two rows directly,
    in the REVERSE of their line_number order: line_number=1 ("bread")
    physically first, line_number=0 ("apple") physically second. Physical/
    insertion order and logical (line_number) order now deliberately
    disagree. With ORDER BY line_number, get() returns ["apple", "bread"]
    regardless of insertion order. Without it, a scan returning physical
    order returns ["bread", "apple"] instead, and the assertion below

    Task 4's review found get() could tear an aggregate under the default
    READ COMMITTED isolation: PostgreSQL gives each of get()'s two SELECTs
    its own snapshot, so a save() committing in between could hand back a
    header from one version and lines from another, and
    Order.total_must_match_lines would turn that healthy read into a 500.
    The fix pins the read transaction to REPEATABLE READ via
    READ_ISOLATION_LEVEL, applied through
    `session.connection(execution_options={"isolation_level": ...})`.

    That mechanism was unverified against a real database until now.
    Testing the race itself would be timing-dependent and flaky; what is
    deterministic, and what this asserts, is that PostgreSQL itself reports
    the isolation level took effect — queried with `SHOW
    transaction_isolation`, the same session variable PostgreSQL uses to
    answer `current_setting('transaction_isolation')`.

    this option. It opens its own session and applies the option directly,

    a later review caught that a deleted isolation call inside get() itself
