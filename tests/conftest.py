    """Remove every `APP_*` variable from the process environment for the
    duration of the block, putting back exactly what was there before on
    the way out.

    A plain context manager, not a fixture, because two call sites need
    this guarantee where NO fixture — session-scoped or otherwise — can
    reach them: `tests/contract/test_conformance.py` calls `create_app()`
    at IMPORT time, before pytest has run a single fixture, and
    `tests/unit/test_contract_drift.py`'s `render_openapi()` is also
    called directly by `just openapi` via `python -c`, entirely outside
    pytest. `_no_developer_app_env_vars` below gives every OTHER test this
    same guarantee as a fixture; this is the form usable where a fixture
    cannot run at all.

    `Settings(_env_file=None)` alone is NOT this guarantee, and it is easy
    to assume it is: `_env_file=None` only stops `Settings` reading a
    `.env` FILE. Pydantic-settings' environment-variable source reads
    `os.environ` unconditionally, regardless of that argument. Confirmed
    directly: with `APP_SERVICE_NAME=zzz` set, `Settings(_env_file=None)
    .service_name` is `"zzz"`, not the field's own default
    `"pyfr-m8-verify"` — the exact leak this function exists to close.

def _no_developer_app_env_vars() -> Iterator[None]:
    """Strip `APP_*` from the environment for the whole test session.

    `justfile` sets `dotenv-load := true`, so a developer's own `.env`
    enters the environment of every recipe, including `just test` — and
    `Settings(_env_file=None)` does not protect against that: it only
    stops `Settings` reading a `.env` FILE itself, and does nothing about
    `APP_*` variables already sitting in `os.environ` by the time pytest
    starts. Without this, a "with no environment" test only passes
    because the shipped `.env.example` happens to match every default;
    a developer whose `.env` diverges gets a confusing, unrelated
    failure. Confirmed: running a single such test with a real
    `APP_ENVIRONMENT` set in the process environment fails it.

    Delegates to `no_app_env_vars` above rather than repeating the same
    `os.environ` surgery a second time — see its docstring for why THAT
    version, not a fixture, is what the two contract-tier modules need.
    A session-scoped fixture can hold that plain context manager open for
    the whole session simply by entering it and yielding inside, instead
    of exiting before the first test runs.
