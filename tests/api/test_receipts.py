"""The receipt endpoint.

Seeding follows tests/api/test_orders.py. Two of these tests cannot use the
POST route, and the reason is worth stating: `internal_note` is not in the
request schema, so an order carrying one cannot be created through the API
at all. Those tests build the Order directly and swap the repository in with
`app.dependency_overrides`, the same mechanism test_orders.py already uses
to swap the payment gateway.
