"""The two readiness tiers.

Gating checks decide whether this instance receives traffic. Informational
checks are reported and never decide anything. The distinction exists
because a shared dependency that the service survives losing — the cache —
would otherwise take EVERY pod out of rotation at the same moment, turning
a latency degradation into a total outage.
