"""Gate 3, and a fifth gate: filenames, and an edit to an already-recorded file.

Gate 3 (below): golang-migrate applies every migration whose version is
greater than the database's current one. A migration merged later but
numbered LOWER than an environment's current version is silently skipped
there, with no error and no warning — spec section 6.4. Sequential numbering
turns that into a git conflict at merge time instead, and the tests in the
first half of this file are what keep the numbering sequential.

Gate 5 (the second half of this file, below the filename checks): every
other gate — this file's own filename checks included — rebuilds the
database from scratch, so none of them can see that an EXISTING migration
file's CONTENT changed. golang-migrate keeps no per-file checksum either, so
a developer who edits 000001_create_orders_tables.up.sql instead of adding a
new migration passes gates 1-4 cleanly: gate 3 sees an unchanged filename,
and gates 1, 2 and 4 all see a freshly built database that matches whatever
the edited file now says. Everywhere that migration has already been
applied — staging, production, every other developer's database — `migrate
up` reports "no change" and the edit never takes effect there. manifest.sha256
records each migration file's hash at the time it was last regenerated, and
the checks below recompute those hashes and fail the moment a RECORDED one no
longer matches — see spec section 6.4 for the write-up of the trap.

No container and no database anywhere in this file: it reads filenames and
file contents, nothing else.
