"""The gate: the shipped PromQL and the Python constants must agree.

Every SLO number lives twice — once in observability/slo.py where the code
reads it, once in ops/prometheus/rules/slo.yml where Prometheus reads it.
Nothing at runtime would notice them diverging. The symptom of divergence
is the worst kind there is: an objective that reports a comfortable number
while users experience something else.

Pure Python and no Docker, so this runs in the fast tier on every commit.
`just o11y-gates` runs promtool over the same files in the container tier.
