    that exercises an unknown order pairs it with an EMPTY store, so it
    cannot tell the two orderings apart — an empty store returns None
    whether it is consulted first or second, and a store-first
    implementation would pass all four of them.

    not have. An order-first implementation still raises
    OrderNotFoundError, because it never gets as far as the store. A
