"""The committed contract must match the code, byte for byte.

Bytes, not parsed structures. A parsed comparison can only say "these
differ"; a byte comparison makes the difference show up in the pull
request as an ordinary diff of openapi.json, which is the entire point of
committing it (spec 8.2, gate 1).

Lives in tests/unit/, not tests/contract/, and that placement is
deliberate rather than an oversight — see the comment on
test_the_committed_contract_matches_the_code below for why.

    `sort_keys=True` so the file has a stable order independent of how
    FastAPI happens to build the dict; `ensure_ascii=False` so a non-ASCII
    description stays readable in the diff rather than becoming escape
    sequences; a trailing newline because every other text file here has
    one and pre-commit's end-of-file-fixer would add it anyway.

    Verified byte-stable across two separate processes — see the plan's
    Verified Fact 2 — which is what makes a byte comparison legitimate.

    `no_app_env_vars()` around `create_app(Settings(_env_file=None))`,
    never a bare `create_app()`. `just openapi` runs this function
    directly with `python -c`, outside pytest entirely, so no fixture
    strips `APP_*` from the environment first — a bare `create_app()`
    would call `load_settings()`, which reads `.env` and whatever `APP_*`
    variables the shell already has. Measured: with `APP_SERVICE_NAME=zzz`
    set, a bare `create_app()` rendered `{"title": "zzz", ...}`.
    `Settings(_env_file=None)` alone does NOT fix this — confirmed
    directly, that argument only stops `Settings` reading a `.env` FILE,
    and pydantic-settings' environment-variable source still reads
    `os.environ` regardless, so `service_name` was still `"zzz"` with
    only that argument changed. `no_app_env_vars()` (see
    tests/conftest.py) is what actually empties the `APP_*` namespace
    first. Without it, `just openapi` would commit whatever a developer's
    own shell happened to have set, and this same function is also what
    `test_the_committed_contract_matches_the_code` below re-renders on
    every run — so the committed file would then fail the drift check for
    every OTHER developer, which is the milestone's central claim — that
    the contract is a deterministic function of the code, not of whoever
    happens to run `just openapi` — failing in practice.

    fresh, INSIDE this function, at test-call time, never at import time —

    and its Schemathesis ASGI-transport ResourceWarning (see that module's

    and executing many requests against a real started lifespan; this test
    calls `.openapi()`, a synchronous schema dump with no lifespan, no

    test and none of the reasons the `contract` marker exists apply to it.
