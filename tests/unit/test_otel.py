    """Force the SDK to re-decide the HTTP semantic-convention mode.

    `_OpenTelemetrySemanticConventionStability._initialize()` (in the
    `opentelemetry-instrumentation` package) reads the
    `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` environment variable exactly ONCE per
    process and then sets its own `_initialized` flag so every later call
    is a no-op that returns the first decision, forever. Under `just
    test`, `tests/api/test_instrumentation.py` calls `instrument_fastapi`
    (which also calls `_opt_in_to_stable_semconv()`) before this file
    even collects, on pytest's default alphabetical module order
    (`tests/api/` sorts before `tests/unit/`) — so by the time
    `test_an_instrumented_client_produces_a_client_span` below runs, the
    decision is ALREADY cached as "stable", regardless of whether
    `instrument_http_client` remembers to opt in itself. A test that
    reads `http.request.method` under those conditions passes even if
    the opt-in call in `instrument_http_client` were deleted — a guard
    that cannot fail is not a guard.

    This fixture resets both places that decision lives, so the test
    below observes the SAME "nothing has opted in yet" state regardless
    of what ran before it in the same process:

    - `_OpenTelemetrySemanticConventionStability._initialized` and its
      `_OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_SIGNAL_MAPPING` dict. These are PRIVATE
      attributes (leading underscore on the class, and on the
      `_semconv.py` module it lives in) of a third-party package we do
      not own — there is no public API to un-decide this, because the
      SDK's own contract is that the decision is made once and never
      revisited. Reaching in here is deliberate: if a future release of
      `opentelemetry-instrumentation` renames `_initialized` or replaces
      the mapping with something else, this fixture raises
      `AttributeError` at test setup — loudly, immediately, and pointing
      straight back at this comment — rather than silently leaving the
      mutation guard below unable to fail.
    - The `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` environment variable itself,
      via `monkeypatch.delenv` rather than `os.environ.pop`: `_opt_in_to_
      stable_semconv()` sets it with `setdefault`, which is a no-op once
      any earlier test has already set it, so without clearing it here
      the "opt-in never happened" state we are trying to reproduce would
      still read a stale "http" left behind by that earlier test.
      `monkeypatch` restores whatever value (or absence) it found, even
      if this test fails partway through.

    Only the two SDK-private attributes need manual restoration below —
    `monkeypatch` already reverses the environment-variable change on its
    own once this fixture's consumer finishes, which is what keeps this
    reset from leaking into every test that runs after it in the same
    session.

    exporter is injected (see its own comment), so the span is visible in
    the exporter as soon as the request completes — no force_flush needed,

    `_opt_in_to_stable_semconv()` entirely. See that fixture's docstring
