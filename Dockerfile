# Apply Debian's security updates at build time. The official python:slim
# tag is rebuilt on Python's schedule, not Debian's, so it lags the
# security archive by days or weeks: the first CI run of the scan gate
# found twelve fixed HIGH and CRITICAL findings (perl-base, gzip, libpcre2,
# libsqlite3) in a base whose fixes had already shipped in Debian 13.7,
# while the same base scanned clean a day earlier against an older
# vulnerability database. `apt-get upgrade` installs exactly the fixed
# versions the scan names, so the image is as current as Debian's archive
# on the day it is built rather than the day the base tag was cut. The
# package lists are removed afterwards so they do not ship in the image.
# The cost is that two builds days apart can differ in Debian package
# versions; the SBOM records which versions a given image carries.

# pip is not used at runtime -- the virtual environment copied in below
# was built by uv -- and the copy the base image ships is the ONLY source
# of vulnerability findings in this image: its vendored msgpack
# (GHSA-6v7p-g79w-8964) and pkg_resources (CVE-2025-47273) are both HIGH,
# both fixed upstream, and both unreachable from anything this service
# runs (M6 plan, Verified Fact 5). Removing pip removes the findings, and
# a tool nobody should run inside a production container. The interpreter
# is named by its full path on purpose: /app/.venv/bin goes first on PATH
# below, and the venv's own python has no pip to uninstall.
