# Run in a container

```bash
just up
```

That builds the image and starts the stack, serving on
<http://localhost:8000>. Once the API is healthy, a one-shot `seed` container
creates five orders through it, so there is something to `GET` before you
have placed anything — see [Getting started](../getting-started.md#start-with-data-in-it).
Stop it with `just down`, which also removes the volumes.

Run these from the project root.

## What the image is

A two-stage build. The first stage resolves and installs dependencies into a
virtual environment. The second copies that environment into a clean base
image and adds nothing else.

The result has **no `uv`, no compiler, no build tools, and no shell utilities
beyond the base image**. Every tool absent from the final layer is a tool an
attacker cannot use if they get code execution.

Other properties worth knowing:

- **Runs as a non-root user** (`app`), created in the image.
- **`uv sync --locked`** — installs exactly the versions in `uv.lock`, and
  *fails* if the lock file is out of date with `pyproject.toml`, rather than
  quietly resolving something new. Builds are reproducible.
- **Dependencies are installed before the source is copied**, so editing a
  Python file does not re-resolve the dependency tree.
- **pip is removed** from the runtime stage. The virtual environment was built
  by uv, nothing at runtime uses pip, and the copy the base image ships was
  the only source of vulnerability findings in the image. Why the image is
  scanned, and why it is still not distroless, is in
  [Supply chain](../reference/supply-chain.md#the-hardened-image).

!!! warning "Both stages must stay on the same Debian release"

    The builder is `uv:0.11-python3.13-trixie-slim` and the runtime is
    `python:3.13-slim-trixie`. Both are Debian trixie, and that is load-bearing:
    a virtual environment built against one version of the C library is not
    safe to run on an older one. If you change one base image, change both.

## Pull the published images instead of building

Every release pushes both images to GHCR (the GitHub Container Registry), for
`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, tagged with the repository's version and
`latest`:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/emadmokhtar/pyfr-m8-verify:vX.Y.Z
docker pull ghcr.io/emadmokhtar/pyfr-m8-verify-migrations:vX.Y.Z
```

`vX.Y.Z` is a tag from the repository's Releases page — the same string as
the git tag. Pin it in anything that deploys. `latest` moves with every
release; it exists for the nightly scan, which wants whatever is current.

The service image runs on its own with no configuration at all — every
dependency is optional, and unset means in-memory:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/emadmokhtar/pyfr-m8-verify:vX.Y.Z
```

The migrations image is the schema and nothing else, built `FROM
migrate/migrate` with `migrations/` copied in. Its entrypoint is `migrate`
itself and its default command is `-path=/migrations up`; the database URL is
deliberately absent from the image and is passed at run time, so it runs as a
Kubernetes init container or a pre-deployment job with the arguments spelled
out:

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/emadmokhtar/pyfr-m8-verify-migrations:vX.Y.Z \
  -path=/migrations -database 'postgres://app:secret@db:5432/app?sslmode=disable' up
```

`?sslmode=disable` is a libpq parameter golang-migrate needs against a server
with no TLS; it belongs on this URL and never in `APP_DATABASE__DSN`, which
rejects it.

What the two images are, how they are tagged and labelled, and what they are
scanned for before the push, is on
[Supply chain](../reference/supply-chain.md#the-images).

## Check an environment before starting

The same settings model that stops a misconfigured container at startup can
be run on its own, against the environment a container would be given:

```bash
docker compose run --rm app python -m pyfr_m8_verify.config_check
```

A bad environment exits 78 with the same message the service would have
printed — the field, what is wrong with it, and the rule that rejected it,
never the value. A good one prints the configuration the service would start
with, as one JSON object, with every `SecretStr` and every URL password
masked. Compare it with what you meant to set. Add `--no-deps` to skip
starting the databases, which the check does not need. Outside compose,
`just config-check` does the same against `.env` on the host.

## The health check

The image declares its own health check. There is no `curl` in the final
image — that is the point of a minimal image — so the check uses the Python
interpreter that is already there, and reads `APP_HTTP_PORT` exactly as the
start command does.

`compose.yaml` deliberately does **not** repeat it. Compose applies the
image's own health check automatically, and a duplicate here would hardcode
the port, drifting from the real one the moment `APP_HTTP_PORT` is overridden.

## The shutdown deadline trap

This one is worth understanding before you deploy to Kubernetes, because it is
silent when you get it wrong.

The container starts uvicorn with `--timeout-graceful-shutdown 30`. On the
shutdown signal, uvicorn stops accepting new connections and lets in-flight
requests finish, for up to 30 seconds.

**That 30 seconds is only a promise if whatever is running the container waits
longer than 30 seconds before killing it.** Otherwise requests still running
when the deadline hits are killed, not drained, no matter what uvicorn was
told.

Docker Compose's own default is 10 seconds — well under uvicorn's 30. So
`compose.yaml` sets it explicitly:

```yaml
stop_grace_period: 40s
```

**Kubernetes has the identical mismatch and needs the identical fix**:
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` on the pod specification, set comfortably above
uvicorn's own deadline.

This is easy to miss precisely because Kubernetes' default (30 seconds)
*equals* uvicorn's deadline here. It does not look wrong. But equal leaves no
margin at all: the two deadlines expire together, so the shutdown uvicorn was
promised time for is cut off exactly as it begins.

Set it to 40 or more, the same way Compose does.

## Configuration

Pass environment variables as normal. `compose.yaml` sets the environment to
`production`, which switches logs from colourised text to one JSON object per
line.

```yaml
environment:
  APP_ENVIRONMENT: production
  APP_LOG__LEVEL: info
```

Every variable is listed in [Configuration](../reference/configuration.md).
A bad value stops the container at startup with exit code 78 and a readable
message, rather than serving broken traffic.

## Reading the logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f app
```

In `production` that is one JSON object per line. To read it as a person,
pipe it through [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/):

```bash
docker compose logs -f app | jq -r '"\(.timestamp) \(.level) \(.event)"'
```

Health-check requests produce no access-log records, so this stays readable
rather than filling with probe traffic. See [Logging](../reference/logging.md).
