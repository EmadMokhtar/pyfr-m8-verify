# Pull in a newer template version through a git merge: `pyfr update`

# update-from-template.md). It runs the updater at the target version --
# the newest release of pyfr-cli on PyPI is, by construction, the newest
# template tag -- and `@latest` makes uvx resolve that instead of reusing
# a cached older tool. `just update v0.12.0` pins both.

# Create the fixed set of orders in pyfr_m8_verify/seed.py against the
# running stack, through the API. Idempotent: the ids it issued are kept in
# .seed-state.json (ignored by git), and only an order that has gone
# missing is re-created. `just up` already runs the same module from a
# compose one-shot; this is for `just dev`, or for re-seeding by hand.

# Everything `up` starts, plus Grafana, Prometheus, Tempo and Loki with the
# dashboards and SLO rules from ops/ mounted in. Grafana is on
# http://localhost:3000 with anonymous admin access — no login.
#
# The two variables are set here rather than in compose.yaml so that one
# compose file serves both this and plain `up`.
#
# Start the stack with the local Grafana observability profile.

# Stop the observability stack and remove its volumes.
o11y-down:
    docker compose --profile o11y down -v

# Validate the SLO rules with promtool, which ships inside the pinned
# grafana/otel-lgtm image — so this needs no separate Prometheus install
# and can never drift from the version that actually evaluates the rules.
#
# `check rules` is syntax. `test rules` is the one that matters: it feeds
# synthetic series through the real rules and asserts the numbers that come
# out, which is the only thing standing between a dropped health-endpoint
# exclusion and an objective that reports 99.99% forever.
#
# The whole ops/prometheus directory is mounted, not just rules/, because
# slo_test.yml sits above it and refers to rules/slo.yml relatively.
#
# The image comes from compose.yaml -- the one place it is pinned (ADR
# 0014) -- through `docker compose config`, which resolves the file the
# same way `just o11y` does. `--profile o11y` because a service under a
# profile is otherwise omitted from the resolved output. Standard-library
# python3 for the one JSON lookup, so this recipe still needs no `uv sync`
# (ci.yml's o11y-gates job installs none).
#
# Check and unit-test the SLO rules with promtool.
